\title{Compute Game Browsing Pressure Index by Department}
\usage{
compute_game_pressure_index(
  hunting_data = NULL,
  season = "latest",
  weights = c(chevreuil = 0.3, cerf = 0.25, sanglier = 0.15, chamois = 0.08, mouflon =
    0.07, daim = 0.06, isard = 0.05, cerf_sika = 0.04),
  normalize_by = "rank",
  dept_forest_area = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hunting_data}{Data.frame from \code{\link{download_hunting_data}}, or NULL
to download automatically.}

\item{season}{Character. Hunting season to use (e.g., "2022-2023").
Default "latest" uses most recent available.}

\item{weights}{Named numeric vector. Weights for species contribution to
browsing pressure. Default weights reflect relative forest impact:
chevreuil (0.30), cerf (0.25), sanglier (0.15), chamois (0.08),
mouflon (0.07), daim (0.06), isard (0.05), cerf_sika (0.04).}

\item{normalize_by}{Character. How to normalize harvest numbers:
"area" (per km2 of forest, requires dept_forest_area), "rank" (percentile rank),
or "minmax" (min-max scaling). Default "rank".}

\item{dept_forest_area}{Named numeric vector. Forest area (km2) by department code.
Only needed if normalize_by = "area". If NULL, uses built-in estimates.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns:
  \itemize{
    \item code_dept: Department code
    \item nom_dept: Department name
    \item pressure_index: Browsing pressure index (0-100)
    \item <species>_harvest: Harvest count for each species present
  }
}
\description{
Calculates a browsing pressure index (0-100) for each department based on
hunting harvest statistics. Higher values indicate higher game populations
and thus higher browsing pressure on forests.
}
\details{
The pressure index combines harvest statistics for 8 large game species
affecting forest regeneration:
\itemize{
  \item Chevreuil (roe deer): Main browser, high impact on regeneration
  \item Cerf (red deer): Significant browser, bark stripping
  \item Sanglier (wild boar): Root damage, seed predation
  \item Chamois: Alpine browser, localized impact
  \item Isard (Pyrenean chamois): Pyrenees only
  \item Mouflon: Mediterranean zones
  \item Daim (fallow deer): Browser, localized populations
  \item Cerf sika (sika deer): Bark stripping, limited range
}

Weights reflect relative impact on forest browsing (not total damage).
Mountain ungulates (chamois, isard, mouflon) have lower weights as they
primarily affect alpine/subalpine forests.

# Compute pressure index for latest season
pressure <- compute_game_pressure_index()

# Get departments with highest pressure
high_pressure <- pressure[pressure$pressure_index > 75, ]

# Use with R4 indicator
