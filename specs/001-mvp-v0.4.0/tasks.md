# Tasks: MVP v0.4.0 - Complete 12-Family Ecosystem Services Referential

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mvp-v0.4.0/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: TDD approach required per constitution (Section IV: Test-First avec Fixtures). All indicator families require test fixtures before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Progress**: 84/141 tasks complete (60%)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Stories 1-4 (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase - can proceed in parallel
- **System Integration (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1-US4 completion
- **Demo Data (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1-US4 completion
- **Advanced Analysis (Phase 9)**: Depends on System Integration (Phase 7)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired features being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Social, P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Fully independent
- **US2 (Productive, P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Fully independent
- **US3 (Energy, P1)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Integrates with US2 (P1 volume) but independently testable
- **US4 (Naturalness, P2)**: Can start after Phase 2 - Requires v0.3.0 T1, B1 indicators but independently testable
- **US5 (Integration, P2)**: Requires US1-US4 complete
- **US6 (Demo Data, P2)**: Requires US1-US4 complete
- **US7 (Analysis, P3)**: Requires US5 complete (needs 12-family system)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (fixtures + test files) MUST be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation
- Implementation order: R/indicators-*.R skeleton → individual indicator functions → validation → exports
- Verify tests pass before marking story complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All T002-T007 marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T016-T018 marked [P] can run in parallel (different utility functions)
- **Once Phase 2 completes**: US1, US2, US3, US4 can all start in parallel (different R/indicators-*.R files)
- **Within each US**: Test fixtures marked [P] can run in parallel (different .rds files)
- **Phase 10 (Polish)**: T133-T135, T139-T140 marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all test fixtures for US1 together:
Task T019: "Create test fixture for S1 (trail density)"
Task T020: "Create test fixture for S2 (accessibility)"
Task T021: "Create test fixture for S3 (population)"
Task T022: "Create reference output fixture"

# After tests written, implement indicators:
Task T028: "Implement indicator_social_trails()"
Task T029: "Implement indicator_social_accessibility()"
Task T030: "Implement indicator_social_proximity()"
```

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

1. **Team completes Phase 1-2 together** (T001-T018)
2. **Once Phase 2 done, split:**
   - Developer A: US1 Social (T019-T034)
   - Developer B: US2 Productive (T035-T051)
   - Developer C: US3 Energy (T052-T066)
3. **Regroup for US4** (all 3 on Naturalness, T067-T084)
4. **Split again:**
   - Developer A: US5 Integration (T085-T095)
   - Developer B: US6 Demo Data (T096-T109)
   - Developer C: US7 Analysis (T110-T132)
5. **Team completes Phase 10 together** (T133-T141)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [US#] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- TDD approach: Tests MUST be written before implementation (constitution requirement)
- Each user story independently completable and testable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Run `devtools::test()` frequently during implementation
- Run `devtools::check()` before marking phases complete

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2026-01-05
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 (Setup) with `/speckit.implement` or manual execution
