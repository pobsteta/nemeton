# analysis-correlation.R
# Cross-Family Correlation Analysis
# MVP v0.3.0 - Multi-Family Indicator Extension

# Functions for multi-criteria analysis:
# - compute_family_correlations(): Correlation matrix for family indices
# - identify_hotspots(): Multi-criteria hotspot detection
# - plot_correlation_matrix(): Visualization helper

# Implementation follows TDD approach - tests written first in test-analysis-correlation.R
# See spec.md User Story 6 for requirements

# Functions will be implemented after tests are written (TDD cycle)
