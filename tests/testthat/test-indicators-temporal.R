# test-indicators-temporal.R
# Unit and integration tests for Temporal Dynamics Family (T) Indicators
# MVP v0.3.0 - Multi-Family Indicator Extension

# Tests for:
# - indicator_temporal_age() (T1)
# - indicator_temporal_change() (T2)

# TDD: Write tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL, then implement functions
# See contracts/temporal-indicators.md for specifications

# Tests will be written during Phase 5 (User Story 3) implementation
