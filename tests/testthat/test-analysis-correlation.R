# test-analysis-correlation.R
# Unit and integration tests for Cross-Family Correlation Analysis
# MVP v0.3.0 - Multi-Family Indicator Extension

# Tests for:
# - compute_family_correlations()
# - identify_hotspots()
# - plot_correlation_matrix()

# TDD: Write tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL, then implement functions
# See spec.md User Story 6 for requirements

# Tests will be written during Phase 8 (User Story 6) implementation
